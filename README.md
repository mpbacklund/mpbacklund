## Hi there 👋

My name is Matthew Backlund. I'm a Computer Scientist at Utah State University graduating in December 2024.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a microservice application that serves data from multiple different database to one central spot. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust in my free time. I'm also learning YOLOv8 for a couple computer vision projects.
