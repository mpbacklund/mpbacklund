## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Matthew Backlund. I'm a Computer Scientist at Utah State University graduating in December 2024.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on a microservice application that serves data from multiple different databases to one central spot. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust in my free time. I'm also learning YOLOv8 for a couple computer vision projects. 

I love crafting system architectures that bring ideas to life with simplicity.
